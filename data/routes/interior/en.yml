# This is a route layout definition.
# The route definition defines which Sitecore components are present on a route,
# what their content data is, and which _placeholder_ they are placed in.

# This particular route definition is for the home route - '/', so it defines the
# components shown on the initial page of the app.

# You may use equivalent JSON files instead of YAML if you prefer;
# however YAML is simpler to read and allows comments like this one :)

# Setting an ID is optional, but it will allow referring to this item in internal links
# the ID can be a app-wide-unique string, or a GUID value.
id: interior-page

# Route-level fields are appropriate for page level data like <title> contents
# Define route level fields in /sitecore/definitions/routes.sitecore

                <p>Our company was founded in 1939 by a hard-working family in Atchison, Kansas. In 1939 a loaf of bread cost eight cents, Lou Gehrig announced his retirement from the New York Yankees, and the film <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> had just made its box office debut. Although a lot has changed since then, the values and work ethic that propelled a small company forward after the Great Depression still persist today. Throughout almost a century of innovation and treating customers with respect, we’ve grown to become one of the nation’s largest employee-owned propane leaders. Our story is a testament to the livelihood of the American dream, and we are proud to fuel the lives of customers all over America.</p>
